## Instructions

Tic Tac Toe is my first project in WDI with GA, It's all about HTML pages, styling with CSS and also JavaScript and jQuery and some other libraries.
In the project I create two HTML pages `index.html` it's the landeing page and `game.html`, also one file for styling `style.css` and one file for javascript `main.js`.

## Introduction to the game
Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, Earth üåç and Sun üåï, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Players can win in these situations:
- Horizontal

- Vertical

Otherwise, it will be no winner (tie):
